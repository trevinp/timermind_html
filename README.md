## Welcome to the Timermind Web Application

The Timermind application allows users to create and delete reminder type entries into a database and display them on various front ends (web, mobile, console) in a secure manner.  The users Google ID is used to filter reminders so only the appropriate items are displayed.

This webapp is a learning project I created that uses web services from the Timermind Web API (also a learning project) that is deployed on Microsoft Azure as an app service.  The database is a SQL Server instance on Azure.

My goal with this application was to learn about deploying Microsoft Web API's and databases onto Azure and creating multiple consumers of the API.  This was a good way to learn about client applications in HTML/Javascript, mobile development, and simple console clients.
