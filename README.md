## Welcome to the Timermind Web Application

The Timermind application allows users to create and delete reminder type entries into a database and display them on various front ends (web, mobile, console) in a secure manner.  The users Google ID is used to filter reminders so only the appropriate items are displayed.

This webapp is a learning project I created that uses web services from the Timermind API (also a learning project) that is deployed on Microsoft Azure.  The database is a SQL Server instance on Azure.
